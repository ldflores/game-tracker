        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            The overall goal of the project is to create a place that allows players of the game 
            <a href="https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/index.html">Super Smash Bros Ultimate</a> 
            track of the losses and wins as well as their to keep track of their wins and losses. 
            Furthermore, players would be able to select the character they either won or lost to.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only site that has something similar, is the <a href="https://www.elitegsp.com/">Elite GSP</a> site which tells you what 
            GSP score you must achieve in order to enter Elite Smash. This doesn’t keep track 
            of your overall statistics or trends as you play the game. It only helps you know 
            what GSP you need. For newer players it may be nice to see which characters you 
            struggle with and see how many wins or loses you had throughout the week. 
            Furthermore, the main 
            <a href="https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/index.html">Super Smash Bros Ultimate</a> 
            website only shows you information about the game and does not provide you with tracking your statistics over time.

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>
            The users of the application will mostly be people who play Super Smash Bros Ultimate Online. 
            These players will be the ones who would be the most interested in keeping track of their 
            losses and wins from online or local play. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When using the app, players will be able to enter a player they use. User’s will also be 
            able to enter a player they lose against after every match. This app will help players keep
            track of wins and lose as well as the character they lose the most against. This then could
            help players see which characters they are losing the most against. In order to make inputting
            data fast, a button with win or loss will be shown and a layout of all characters will be 
            displayed. If a player loses they would click lose and then select the image of the character 
            they lost to.
            <ol class="site-abilities">
            <li>Choose your main character</li>
            <li>Track losses against characters</li>
            <li>View characters you lose the most against</li>
            <li>View total wins and losses</li>
            </ol>
